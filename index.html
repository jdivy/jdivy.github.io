  <p>So what does it mean to be <em>distributed</em>?</p>
</div>

<div id="distributed" class="step slide-box" data-x="3000" data-y="1000">
  <p>To paraphrase Wikipedia, "no canonical, reference copy of the [repository] exists by default". In other words,
    <em>every</em> collaborator has a <em>full</em> copy of the repository.</p>

  <p id="in-practice">In practice, one working copy of a given repository is usually kept on a 'central' system.</p>
</div>
<div id="others" class="step slide-box" data-x="3000" data-y="2000">
  <p>However, you don't have to collaborate with others to reap the benefits of git.</p>

  <p>Just initialize any folder as a git repository and you're off to the races.</p>

  <h2><strong>Benefits of DVCS/git, just to name a few:</strong></h2>
  <ul>
    <li>* You have a complete copy of the repository - the full history</li>
    <li>* You don't need network connectivity to be productive</li>
    <li>* Much higher performance - common operations are local</li>
    <li>* If the main server is down...who cares</li>
    <li>* A 'server' in the SVN sense is not even technically necessary</li>
    <li>* Use it on your own, to track any content changes over time</li>
    <li>* Everyone is a 'backup' for everyone (when collaborating)</li>
    <li>* Merging is actually fun and fast, not an 'up to 8 hour' process</li>
    <li>* More than just a 'centralized' workflow is possible</li>
    <li>* ...</li>

  <p>Joel on Software:</p>

  <p>With distributed version control, the <em>distributed</em> part is actually not the most interesting part.</p>

  <p>The interesting part is that these systems think in terms of <em>changes</em>, not in terms of <em>versions</em>.
  </p>

  <p>That's a very zen-like thing to say, I know. Traditional version control thinks: OK, I have version 1. And now I
    have version 2. And now I have version 3.</p>

  <p>And distributed version control thinks, I had nothing. And then I got these changes. And then I got these other
    changes.</p>

  <p>It's a different Program Model, so the user model has to change.</p>

  <p>...</p>

</div>
<div id="joel2" class="step joel" data-x="-2000" data-y="6000" data-z="-5000">

  <p>If you come at Mercurial with a Subversion mindset, things will <em>almost</em> work, but when they don't, you'll
    be confused, unhappy, and unsuccessful, and you'll hate Mercurial.</p>

  <p>Whereas if you free your mind and reimagine version control, and grok the zen of the difference between thinking
    about managing the <em>versions</em> vs. thinking about managing the <em>changes</em>, you'll become enlightened
    and happy and realize that this is the way version control was meant to work.</p>

  <p>And here is the most important point, indeed, <em>the</em> most important thing that we've learned about
    developer productivity in a decade. It's so important that it merits a place as the very last opinion piece that I
    write, so if you only remember one thing, remember this:</p>

  <p>When you manage <em>changes</em> instead of managing <em>versions</em>, merging works better, and therefore, you
    can branch any time your organizational goals require it, because merging back will be a piece of cake.</p>

</div>
<div id="joel3" class="step joel" data-x="-2000" data-y="7200" data-z="-6000">

  <p>I can't tell you how many Subversion users have told me the following story: "We tried to branch our code, and
    that worked fine. But when it came time to merge <em>back</em>, it was a complete nightmare and we had to
    practically reapply every change by hand, and we swore <em>never again</em> and we developed a new way of
    developing software using <strong>if</strong> statements instead of branches."</p>

  <p>With distributed version control, <em>merges are easy</em> and work <em>fine</em>. So you can actually have a
    stable branch and a development branch, or create long-lived branches for your QA team where they test things
    before deployment, or you can create short-lived branches to try out new ideas and see how they work.</p>

  <p>This is too important to miss out on. This is possibly the biggest advance in software development technology in
    the ten years I've been writing articles here.</p>

  <p>Or, to put it another way, I'd go back to C++ before I gave up on Mercurial.</p>

  <p>If you are using Subversion, stop it. Just stop. Subversion = Leeches. Mercurial and Git = Antibiotics. <em>We
    have better technology now.</em></p>
